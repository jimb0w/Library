@article{SattarLancet2010,
	abstract = {Summary
Background
Trials of statin therapy have had conflicting findings on the risk of development of diabetes mellitus in patients given statins. We aimed to establish by a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data whether any relation exists between statin use and development of diabetes.
Methods
We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1994 to 2009, for randomised controlled endpoint trials of statins. We included only trials with more than 1000 patients, with identical follow-up in both groups and duration of more than 1 year. We excluded trials of patients with organ transplants or who needed haemodialysis. We used the I2 statistic to measure heterogeneity between trials and calculated risk estimates for incident diabetes with random-effect meta-analysis.
Findings
We identified 13 statin trials with 91 140 participants, of whom 4278 (2226 assigned statins and 2052 assigned control treatment) developed diabetes during a mean of 4 years. Statin therapy was associated with a 9% increased risk for incident diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1·09; 95% CI 1·02--1·17), with little heterogeneity (I2=11%) between trials. Meta-regression showed that risk of development of diabetes with statins was highest in trials with older participants, but neither baseline body-mass index nor change in LDL-cholesterol concentrations accounted for residual variation in risk. Treatment of 255 (95% CI 150--852) patients with statins for 4 years resulted in one extra case of diabetes.
Interpretation
Statin therapy is associated with a slightly increased risk of development of diabetes, but the risk is low both in absolute terms and when compared with the reduction in coronary events. Clinical practice in patients with moderate or high cardiovascular risk or existing cardiovascular disease should not change.
Funding
None.},

	abstract = {Elevated blood pressure (BP) is major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted predominantly in populations of European ancestry have identified \&gt;2,000 BP-associated loci, but other ancestries have been less well-studied. We conducted GWAS of systolic, diastolic, pulse, and mean arterial BP in 100,453 Chinese adults. We identified 128 non-overlapping loci associated with one or more BP traits, harbouring 81 novel associations. Despite strong genetic correlations between populations, we identified appreciably higher heritability and larger variant effect sizes in Chinese compared with European or Japanese ancestry populations. Using instruments derived from these GWAS, multivariable Mendelian randomisation demonstrated strong causal associations of specific BP traits with CVD, including systolic BP with intracranial haemorrhage, and pulse pressure with carotid plaque. The findings reinforce the need for studies in diverse populations to understand the genetic determinants of BP traits and their role in disease risk.Competing Interest StatementWei Gan is now an employee of Novo Nordisk Research Centre Oxford LtdFunding StatementThis research was funded in whole, or in part, by the Wellcome Trust [212946/Z/18/Z, 202922/Z/16/Z, 104085/Z/14/Z, 088158/Z/09/Z].Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, China, 005/2004) and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford (UK, 025-04), and all participants provided written informed consent.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Objectives To characterise the costs to the UK National Health Service of cardiovascular (CV) events among individuals receiving lipid-modifying therapy.Design Retrospective cohort study using Clinical Practice Research Datalink records from 2006 to 2012 to identify individuals with their first and second CV-related hospitalisations (first event and second event cohorts). Within-person differences were used to estimate CV-related outcomes.Setting Patients in the UK who had their first CV event between January 2006 and March 2012.Participants Patients >=18 years who had a CV event and received at least 2 lipid-modifying therapy prescriptions within 180 days beforehand.Primary and secondary outcome measures Direct medical costs (2014 {\textsterling}) were estimated in 3 periods: baseline (pre-event), acute (6 months afterwards) and long-term (subsequent 30 months). Primary outcomes included incremental costs, resource usage and total costs per period.Results There were 24 093 patients in the first event cohort of whom 5274 were included in the second event cohort. The mean incremental acute CV event costs for the first event and second event cohorts were: coronary artery bypass graft/percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (CABG/PTCA) {\textsterling}5635 and {\textsterling}5823, myocardial infarction {\textsterling}4275 and {\textsterling}4301, ischaemic stroke {\textsterling}3512 and {\textsterling}4572, heart failure {\textsterling}2444 and {\textsterling}3461, unstable angina {\textsterling}2179 and {\textsterling}2489 and transient ischaemic attack {\textsterling}1537 and {\textsterling}1814. The mean incremental long-term costs were: heart failure {\textsterling}848 and {\textsterling}2829, myocardial infarction {\textsterling}922 and {\textsterling}1385, ischaemic stroke {\textsterling}973 and {\textsterling}682, transient ischaemic attack {\textsterling}705 and {\textsterling}1692, unstable angina {\textsterling}328 and {\textsterling}677, and CABG/PTCA {\textsterling}-368 and {\textsterling}599. Hospitalisation accounted for 95\% of acute and 61\% of long-term incremental costs. Higher comorbidity was associated with higher long-term costs.Conclusions Revascularisation and myocardial infarction were associated with the highest incremental costs following a CV event. On the basis of real-world data, the economic burden of CV events in the UK is substantial, particularly among those with greater comorbidity burden.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inclisiran inhibits hepatic synthesis of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9). The comparison of inclisiran with statin versus statin alone in the ORION-10 trial demonstrated significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Our study explored whether the use of inclisiran with statin versus statin alone for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is cost effective from the Australian healthcare perspective, based on the price of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors. METHODS: A Markov model was developed based on the ORION-10 trial to model outcomes and costs incurred by patients over a lifetime analysis. The three health states were 'alive with cardiovascular disease (CVD)', 'alive with recurrent CVD', and 'dead'. Cost and utilities were estimated from published sources. The cost of inclisiran was estimated from the annual cost of evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor currently available in Australia (AU$6334, based on 2020 data). Outcomes of interest were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost per year of life saved (YoLS). All costs, QALYs and YoLS were discounted at 5% per annum in line with Australian standards. RESULTS: Among 1000 subjects followed-up over a lifetime analysis, inclisiran with statin compared with statin alone prevented 235 non-fatal myocardial infarctions (NFMIs; 151 NFMI and 84 repeat NFMI cases) and 114 coronary revascularisation cases, and increased years of life by 0.549 (discounted) and QALYs by 0.468 (discounted). At an annual price of AU$6334, the net marginal cost was AU$58,965 per person. The above values equated to ICERs of AU$107,402 per YoLS and AU$125,732 per QALY gained. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$50,000, inclisiran would have to be priced 60% lower than other available PCSK9 inhibitors to be considered cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: As an adjunct therapy to statin treatment in those who have persistently elevated LDL-C despite optimal statin therapy, inclisiran is effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic CVD. Inclisiran is not cost effective from the Australian healthcare perspective, assuming acquisition costs of current PCSK9 inhibitors. The cost of inclisiran would have to be 60% lower than that of evolocumab.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inclisiran is a novel, cholesterol-lowering therapy, with a long duration of effect, administered every 6 months (subcutaneously by a healthcare professional). In the ORION-10 trial in US patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in addition to maximum tolerated statins, with or without ezetimibe, inclisiran demonstrated statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of up to 51%. This is the first peer-reviewed publication to investigate the price at which inclisiran is cost effective in the US. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the maximum price at which inclisiran is cost effective in addition to standard of care, in US patients with ASCVD, versus standard of care alone, at different willingness-to-pay thresholds. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A lifetime Markov model from the US health system perspective, including 15 health states, was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of inclisiran. The following states were separated by time from a previous cardiovascular event (0-1 years, 1-2 years, 2+ years ['stable']): initial, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Additional states included revascularization and death (cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular causes). Baseline risk of cardivoascular events were from US database sources or published literature. Reductions in LDL-C from inclisiran were from the ORION-10 trial. LDL-C reduction was used to adjust baseline risk of cardiovascular events, based on established relationships between 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C and decreases in cardiovascular events, from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists studies. The population included adults with a history of ASCVD, and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite maximum tolerated doses of statin therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Inclisiran as an adjunct to standard of care, compared with standard of care alone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The threshold price of inclisiran. RESULTS: Inclisiran as an adjunct to standard of care resulted in threshold annual inclisiran prices of $6383, $9973, and $13,563 at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY, inclisiran had a 100% probability of being cost effective, with an annual price below $9000. At the publicly available price of $3250 per dose, inclisiran was found to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio just above the $50,000 per QALY threshold, of $51,686. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified the price at which inclisiran is cost effective for the US health system, at generally accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.},

	abstract = {Background
The methods used to estimate health-state utility values (HSUV) for multiple health conditions can produce very different values. Economic results generated using baselines of perfect health are not comparable with those generated using baselines adjusted to reflect the HSUVs associated with the health condition. Despite this, there is no guidance on the preferred techniques and little research describing the effect on cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) results when using the different methods.
Methods
Using a cardiovascular disease (CVD) model and cost per QALY thresholds, we assess the consequence of using different baseline health-state utility profiles (perfect health, no history of CVD, general population) in conjunction with models (minimum, additive, multiplicative) frequently used to approximate scores for health states with multiple health conditions. HSUVs are calculated using the EQ-5D UK preference-based algorithm.
Results
Assuming a baseline of perfect health ignores the natural decline in quality of life associated with age, overestimating the benefits of treatment. The results generated using baselines from the general population are comparable to those obtained using baselines from individuals with no history of CVD. The minimum model biases results in favor of younger-aged cohorts. The additive and multiplicative models give similar results.
Conclusion
Although further research in additional health conditions is required to support our findings, our results highlight the need for analysts to conform to an agreed reference case. We demonstrate that in CVD, if data are not available from individuals without the health condition, HSUVs from the general population provide a reasonable approximation.},

Data were used to calculate lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease and its first incident manifestations adjusted for competing non-cardiovascular death.Results During follow-up of up to 20.1 years, 2888 participants developed cardiovascular disease (826 coronary heart disease, 1198 cerebrovascular disease, 762 heart failure, and 102 other cardiovascular death). At age 55, overall lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease were 67.1\% (95\% confidence interval 64.7\% to 69.5\%) for men and 66.4\% (64.2\% to 68.7\%) for women. Lifetime risks of first incident manifestations of cardiovascular disease in men were 27.2\% (24.1\% to 30.3\%) for coronary heart disease, 22.8\% (20.4\% to 25.1\%) for cerebrovascular disease, 14.9\% (13.3\% to 16.6\%) for heart failure, and 2.3\% (1.6\% to 2.9\%) for other deaths from cardiovascular disease. For women the figures were 16.9\% (13.5\% to 20.4\%), 29.8\% (27.7\% to 31.9\%), 17.5\% (15.9\% to 19.2\%), and 2.1\% (1.6\% to 2.7\%), respectively. Differences in the number of events that developed over the lifespan in women compared with men (per 1000) were -7 for any cardiovascular disease, -102 for coronary heart disease, 70 for cerebrovascular disease, 26 for heart failure, and -1 for other cardiovascular death; all outcomes manifested at a higher age in women. Patterns were similar when analyses were restricted to hard atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, but absolute risk differences between men and women were attenuated for both coronary heart disease and stroke.Conclusions At age 55, though men and women have similar lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease, there are considerable differences in the first manifestation. Men are more likely to develop coronary heart disease as a first event, while women are more likely to have cerebrovascular disease or heart failure as their first event, although these manifestations appear most often at older ages.},

	abstract = {Background and aims
There are guideline discussions on a lifetime approach to cardiovascular risk. Many of the available risk models estimate the short-term, usually 10-year risk of non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVD) grouped together. We aimed to develop lifetime risk models for non-fatal coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure and death from CVD and non-CVD.
Methods
We included 92,915 individuals who had participated in a community-based lifestyle intervention programme at 40, 50 and/or 60 years of age. Their collected data on selected risk factors were linked to register data on hospitalizations and death. Parametric multivariable survival regression with a competing risks approach was employed to model cause-specific hazards, which were translated into cumulative incidence functions to provide the risk of experiencing each event separately. All analyses were performed gender-age wise. For illustrative purposes, ``better'' and ``worse'' risk profiles were created by setting three modifiable risk factors to the best and worst levels, respectively.
Results
Most of the risk factors qualified for inclusion in the regressions. Men had a higher risk of cardiovascular events and the events occurred at a younger age than women. In the created risk profiles, where serum total cholesterol, smoking status and blood pressure were modified, an excessive number of CVD events were observed in the worse profiles.
Conclusions
Using these models, the lifetime risk of each of the first CVD events can be estimated for different risk factor profiles. Since the predictions are diagnosis specific, the estimates are more accurate.},

	abstract = {Background: Factors determining lipoprotein concentrations in the fetus are not yet fully understood. We postulated that an important factor is the genetic make-up of the mother. In the present study, we examined the associations between the cord blood concentrations of lipoproteins of 525 newborns and the polymorphisms present in their mothers on the genes of apolipoprotein E (APOE∗E2, ∗E3, ∗E4), apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3∗C3238G also called APOC3∗S2) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL∗S447X). Results: Newborns born of mothers with APOE∗E2 allele had significantly lower cord blood LDL-C (P<0.01) and apoB (P<0.001) and significantly higher cord blood HDL-C and apoA1 (all P-values < 0.03) compared to those born of mothers with APOE∗E3E3 genotype. These associations were independent of the presence of APOE∗E2 allele in the newborns. Similarly, APOC3∗S2 in mothers was associated with significantly lower (all P<0.001) cord blood LDL-C, apoB, HDL-C and apoA1. In contrast, LPL∗S447X in mothers lowered significantly cord blood LDL-C and apoB only when LPL∗S447X was present in newborns. Most of the effects of these maternal polymorphisms on the newborns were independent of the changes of maternal lipoproteins generated by these polymorphisms. Conclusions: This is the first evidence that maternal genetic variations influence fetal lipoprotein concentrations, independent of the genetic status of the fetus and of the variations of maternal lipoprotein concentrations generated by these genetic variants. It suggests that proteic components of maternal lipoproteins strongly control the metabolism of maternal lipoproteins carried out at the surface of the placenta to assure the cholesterol delivery to the fetus.},

When the incidence of an outcome of interest is common in the study population (>10%), the adjusted odds ratio derived from the logistic regression can no longer approximate the risk ratio. The more frequent the outcome, the more the odds ratio overestimates the risk ratio when it is more than 1 or underestimates it when it is less than 1.

	abstract = {{Recent European guidelines recommend in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to achieve a reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol of at least 50\\% if the baseline low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level is between 1.8 and 3.5 mmol/L. Systematic reviews have associated a given statin/dose combination with a fixed percentage low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol response. Algorithms for detecting cases and estimating the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolaemia often rely on such fixed percentage reductions.We used data from 915 coronary patients participating in the EUROASPIRE V study in whom atorvastatin or rosuvastatin therapy was initiated at hospital discharge and who were still using these drugs at the same dose at a follow-up visit 6 or more months later. Pre and on-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were compared across the full low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol range. The prevalence of FH was estimated using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, once using observed pre-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and once using imputed pre-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol by following the common strategy of applying fixed correction factors to on-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Inter-individual variation in the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol response to a fixed statin and dose was considerable, with a strong inverse relation of percentage reductions to pre-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The percentage low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol response was markedly lower at the left end of the pre-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol range especially for levels less than 3 mmol/L. The estimated prevalence of familial hypercholesterolaemia was 2\\% if using observed pre-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and 10\\% when using imputed low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol.The inter-individual variation in the percentage low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol response to a given dose of a statin is largely dependent on the pre-treatment level: the lower the pre-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level the smaller the percentage low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol reduction. The use of uniform correction factors to estimate pre-treatment low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol is not justified.}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have demonstrated that either initiating or up-titrating a statin dose substantially reduce Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. However, statin adherence in actual practice tends to be suboptimal, leading to diminished effectiveness. This study aims to use real-world data to determine the effect on LDL-C levels and LDL-C goal attainment rates, when selected statins are titrated in Asian patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study over a 5-year period, from April 2014 to March 2019 was conducted on a cohort of multi-ethnic adult Asian patients with clinical diagnosis of Dyslipidaemia in a primary care clinic in Singapore. The statins were classified into low-intensity (LI), moderate-intensity (MI) and high-intensity (HI) groups according to the 2018 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Blood Cholesterol Guidelines. Patients were grouped into "No statin", "Non-titrators" and "Titrators" cohorts based on prescribing patterns. For the "Titrators" cohort, the mean percentage change in LDL-C and absolute change in LDL-C goal attainment rates were computed for each permutation of statin intensity titration. RESULTS: Among the cohort of 11,499 patients, with a total of 266,762 visits, there were 1962 pairs of LDL-C values associated with a statin titration. Initiation of LI, MI and HI statin resulted in a lowering of LDL-C by 21.6% (95%CI = 18.9-24.3%), 28.9% (95%CI = 25.0-32.7%) and 25.2% (95%CI = 12.8-37.7%) respectively. These were comparatively lower than results from clinical trials (30 to 63%). The change of LDL-C levels due to up-titration, down-titration, and discontinuation were - 12.4% to - 28.9%, + 13.2% to + 24.6%, and + 18.1% to + 32.1% respectively. The improvement in LDL-C goal attainment ranged from 26.5% to 47.1% when statin intensity was up-titrated. CONCLUSION: In this study based on real-world data of Asian patients in primary care, it was shown that although statin titration substantially affected LDL-C levels and LDL-C goal attainment rates, the magnitude was lower than results reported from clinical trials. These results should be taken into consideration and provide further insight to clinicians when making statin adjustment recommendations in order to achieve LDL-C targets in clinical practice, particularly for Asian populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statins are widely prescribed for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but their effectiveness is dependent on the level of adherence and persistence. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the patterns of switching, adherence and persistence among the Australian general population with newly dispensed statins. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a random sample of data from the Australian national prescription claims data. Switching, adherence to and persistence with statins were assessed for people starting statins from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2019. Switching was defined as either switching to another intensity of statin, to another statin or to a non-statin agent. Non-persistence to treatment was defined as discontinuation (i.e. ≥90 days with no statin) of coverage. Adherence was measured using proportion of days covered (PDC), and patients with PDC < 0.80 were considered non-adherent. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare discontinuation, switching and reinitiation between different statins. RESULTS: A cohort of 141,062 people dispensed statins and followed over a median duration of 2.5 years were included. Of the cohort, 29.3% switched statin intensity, 28.4% switched statin type, 3.7% switched to ezetimibe and in 2.7%, ezetimibe was added as combination therapy during the study period. Overall, 58.8% discontinued statins based on the 90-day gap criteria, of whom 55.2% restarted. The proportion of people non-adherent was 24.0% at 6 months to 49.0% at 5 years. People on low and moderate intensity statins were more likely to discontinue compared to those on high-intensity statins (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.31), (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.14-1.42), respectively. Compared to maintaining same statin type and intensity, switching statins, which includes up-titration (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.70 to 0.86) was associated with less likelihood of discontinuation after reinitiation. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term persistence and adherence to statins remains generally poor among Australians, which limits the effectiveness of these medicines and the consequent health impact they may provide for individuals (and by extension, the population impact when poor persistence and adherence is considered in the statin-taking population). Switching between statins is prevalent in one third of statin users, although any clinical benefit of the observed switching trend is unknown. This, combined with the high volume of statin prescriptions, highlights the need for better strategies to address poor persistence and adherence.},

	abstract = {{For more than 20 years, primary prevention of coronary heart disease has included strategies intended to improve overall serum lipid concentrations among youths.To examine trends in lipid concentrations among youths from 1988-1994 through 2007-2010.Cross-sectional analysis of serum lipid concentrations among 16 116 youths aged 6 to 19 years who participated in the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 3 time periods: 1988-1994, 1999-2002, and 2007-2010.Among all youths, mean serum total cholesterol (TC), non--high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non--HDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); and among adolescents only, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and geometric mean triglyceride levels. Trends in adverse lipid concentrations are reported for TC levels of 200 mg/dL and greater, non--HDL-C levels of 145 mg/dL and greater, HDL-C levels of less than 40 mg/dL, LDL-C levels of 130 mg/dL and greater, and triglyceride levels of 130 mg/dL and greater.Among youths aged 6 to 19 years between 1988-1994 and 2007-2010, there was a decrease in mean TC (from 165 mg/dL [95\\% CI, 164-167] to 160 mg/dL [95\\% CI, 158-161]; P \\&lt; .001) and a decrease in the prevalence of elevated TC (from 11.3\\% [95\\% CI, 9.8\\%-12.7\\%] to 8.1\\% [95\\% CI, 6.7\\%-9.5\\%]; P = .002). Mean HDL-C significantly increased between 1988-1994 and 2007-2010, but the prevalence of low HDL-C did not change. Mean non--HDL-C and prevalence of elevated non--HDL-C both significantly decreased over the study period. In 2007-2010, 22\\% (95\\% CI, 20.3\\%-23.6\\%) of youths had either a low HDL-C level or high non--HDL-C, which was lower than the 27.2\\% (95\\% CI, 24.6\\%-29.7\\%) in 1988-1994 (P = .001). Among adolescents (aged 12-19 years) between 1988-1994 and 2007-2010, there was a decrease in mean LDL-C (from 95 mg/dL [95\\% CI, 92-98] to 90 mg/dL [95\\% CI, 88-91]; P = .003) and a decrease in geometric mean triglycerides (from 82 mg/dL [95\\% CI, 78-86] to 73 mg/dL [95\\% CI, 70-76]; P \\&lt; .001). Prevalence of elevated LDL-C and triglycerides between 1988-1994 and 2007-2010 also significantly decreased.Between 1988-1994 and 2007-2010, a favorable trend in serum lipid concentrations was observed among youths in the United States but almost 1 in 10 had elevated TC in 2007-2010.}},

	abstract = {People who maintain ideal cardiovascular heath have a low lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, encouraging people to achieve ideal cardiovascular health represents an important opportunity to improve the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, preventing cardiovascular disease by promoting ideal cardiovascular health requires shifting the focus from treating disease after it develops to preventing cardiovascular events before they happen by slowing the progression of atherosclerosis. Because atherogenic lipoproteins play a central causal role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, maintaining optimal lipid levels is necessary to achieve ideal cardiovascular health. This review describes the cumulative effect of lipid-carrying lipoproteins on the risk of cardiovascular disease, estimates the magnitude of the clinical benefit that can be achieved by maintaining optimal lipid levels, identifies the most effective timing for implementing strategies designed to achieve optimal lipid levels, and provides a clinical pathway to help people achieve the lipid levels necessary for ideal cardiovascular health.},

Differences in plasma LDL-C, SBP, and cardiovascular event rates between the groups were compared to estimate associations with lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease.Differences in plasma LDL-C and SBP compared with participants with both genetic scores below the median. Genetic risk scores higher than the median were associated with lower LDL-C and lower SBP.Odds ratio (OR) for major coronary events, defined as coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization.The mean age of the 438 952 participants was 65.2 years (range, 40.4-80.0 years), 54.1\\% were women, and 24 980 experienced a first major coronary event. Compared with the reference group, participants with LDL-C genetic scores higher than the median had 14.7-mg/dL lower LDL-C levels and an OR of 0.73 for major coronary events (95\\% CI, 0.70-0.75; P \\&lt; .001).

In a 4 × 4 factorial analysis, exposure to increasing genetic risk scores and lower LDL-C levels and SBP was associated with dose-dependent lower risks of major coronary events. In a meta-regression analysis, combined exposure to 38.67-mg/dL lower LDL-C and 10-mm Hg lower SBP was associated with an OR of 0.22 for major coronary events (95\\% CI, 0.17-0.26; P \\&lt; .001), and 0.32 for cardiovascular death (95\\% CI, 0.25-0.40; P \\&lt; .001).Lifelong genetic exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower systolic blood pressure was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.
